    Setup the Mongo DB Database.
    Setup the Codebase
    Deliverables:
	•	Database that can be queried for:
		•	Frequency of threads per malware family
		•	Number of responses for each topic (Thread)
		•	Average number of responses for each malware family
		•	Duration a topic (Thread) is being actively discussed
		•	Average duration a malware family is being actively discussed
	  	Database will not be uploaded to Git, but rather shared using google drive with access given to team members and the graduate TA
	•	The repository will be updated with a skelton code base with view, model, controller design.
	•	Dummy index page will be availale when the node server is run.
	•	Updated readme file with instuctions added about how to run the nodeJS server and setup the database


Oct 30th
    Create a simple visualization
    Deliverables: 
    •	An interactive web_based visualization showing top N viruses based on the number of responses
	  	•	It allows users to specify the N or lower limit to number of responses.
	  	•	It quantifies the harm by showing how popular/widespread the virus is.

Nov 6th

	Work on data aggregation.
    Show what harm users have mainly suffered
    •	Itentify/Annotate different types of Harm (System slowdown/ System Crash / Ad Popup)
    •	Analyze 1.3 million post data top compute statistics with respect to each type of Harm caused.
    •	Create a simple visualization
    Deliverables
    •	csv file with the the following information:
	    •	thread count / Malware Family for each Harm Type 
	    •	Average number of responses for each Harm Type 
	    •	Average duration a Harm Type is being actively discussed
	  	•	Most common symptoms of a Harm Type
	•	An interactive web_based visualization showing N most frequent Harm Types
		•	User can specify N or the lower limit of the count
		This visualization will need furthur work going ahead.
